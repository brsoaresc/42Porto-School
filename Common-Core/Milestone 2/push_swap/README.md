###

<p align="left">The Push_swap project is an advanced programming task in C that aims to sort a sequence of numbers using two stacks and a limited set of operations. It is a classic exercise in algorithms, focusing on efficiency, optimization, and data structure manipulation.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Purpose</h2>

###

<p align="left">Create a C program called push_swap that takes a list of integers as input and produces the smallest possible sequence of instructions to sort them in ascending order.<br>This project teaches the fundamentals of sorting algorithms, complexity analysis, and optimization.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Project Components</h2>

###

<p align="left">- Create and manage stacks a and b using dynamic structures (linked lists or arrays).<br>- Ensure that all operations (sa, pb, ra, etc.) work correctly.<br>- Write the main algorithm that determines which operations to execute to sort the stack.<br>- The algorithm must choose optimized operations depending on the initial configuration of numbers.<br><br>**Stack (LIFO)<br>A Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are inserted and removed only from the top.<br>The project uses two stacks:<br>a: Initially contains the unsorted numbers.<br>b: Starts empty and is used temporarily to assist in sorting.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Project Challenges</h2>

###

<p align="left">1. Optimization:<br><br>- The biggest challenge is implementing an efficient algorithm that uses the smallest number of operations.<br>- Different initial configurations require different strategies, such as:<br>    . Dividing numbers into smaller blocks to sort them.<br>    . Using advanced sorting techniques tailored to the projectâ€™s constraints.<br><br><br>2.Memory Management:<br><br>- The project requires that all allocated memory be properly freed.<br>- Memory leaks will result in a loss of points.</p>
