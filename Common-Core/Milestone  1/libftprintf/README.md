<h1 align="left">libftprintf</h1>

###

<p align="left">The libftprintf project aims to create a C library that implements a function called ft_printf(), which should mimic the printf() function from the C standard library. This project is a way to understand how variable arguments are handled and how to manipulate strings and numbers in C, as well as learning how to work with static libraries and create custom libraries.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Project Description:</h2>

###

<p align="left">The ft_printf() function will receive a format string and an indefinite number of parameters, and it must interpret and print the values according to the specified format. To do this, you will use the macros va_start, va_arg, and va_end to manipulate the parameters passed to the function flexibly.</p>

<h3 align="left">Educational objectives:</h3>

###

<p align="left">- Understanding variable arguments: The main takeaway from this project is learning how to handle variable arguments. This is done using the macros va_start, va_arg, va_copy, and va_end.<br><br>- Manipulating different types of data: You will learn how to manipulate and convert different data types (characters, strings, integers, pointers, etc.) and how to print them in different formats.<br><br>- Working with static libraries: You will also learn how to create and use static libraries in C, an important concept in many software systems.</p>

###

<h3 align="left">How to test the function:</h3>

###

<p align="left">The behavior of the ft_printf() function should be tested by comparing the result of your implementation with the original printf() function to ensure that both produce the same results for the same inputs.</p>
